        Hello, my name is Christian Laurienzo. I'm a husband, brother, son, and professional software
        developer. I've been developing professionally for the past {{yearsDeveloping}} years. My current
        experience in a production environment involves the entire stack. Although, I prefer to work closer
        to the client side. The concepts of user interfaces and experiences, I find to be a bridge between 
        now and my earlier education in fine arts(painting, drawing, digital, etc.).
